## This is a velocity comment.  It will not appear in the created file.
## In this sample, Settings 1 and 2 are required, and are therefore replaced
## here unconditionally.  Setting 3 is optional, and the XML element is 
## created for it only if a value is specified by the user.
<configFile>
    <setting1>$instance-setting1</setting1>
    <setting2>$instance-setting2</setting2>
#if($instance-setting3)
