<!-- This is a very simple sample to demo the use of workflow to workflow execution feature, in this step, only mondatory elements for this feature are specified:
		- callingStepWeight
		- calledWorkflowDescription
		- calledWorkflowID
		As the element calledWorkflowDefinitionFile is NOT specified in this step, user has to input their own valid definition file path when prompt for user to create the called workflow instance.
		The element calledWorkflowID is specified to indicate that the called workflow instance should has the same workflowID in its definition file.
		Here the called workflow will be workflow_sample_calledwfBasic.xml.
		If a instance with the specified calledWorkflowID already exists, workflow will directly open this instance when user start perform it, if the instance does not exist or multiple instances
		with the calledWorkflowID exist, a dialog will pop up for user to create a new called workflow instance.

		Additionally, <variableName> element will map the variable "sampleString" in this calling workflow to the variable "demoString" in the called workflow

		Note: When a user specifies the XML definition and creates the called workflow successfully, the variables that meet the mapping rules will be transferred
		from the calling workflow to the called workflow only once, that means, no matter how many times the user perform the calling step in future, those 
		variable values will not be updated. But if user decide to change the existing called workflow, this will be treated as creating a new called
		workflow, so the mapped variables will be transferred again in this case.
