<!-- Following is the Document Type Definition (DTD) section of the XML document. Workflow
	 XML files do not use the DTD to validate the XML document (a schema is used instead).
	 However, the DTD is used to declare external files which contain portions of the 
	 workflow XML. A file reference must be in the form of a relative path, and it must
	 exist within the same "container" as this XML file (that is, if the XML file is 
	 shipped in the UNIX file system, these external files must exist within the same 
	 directory, or within a sub-directory. If the XML file is shipped in an MVS partitioned
	 data set, these external files must exist as members within the same PDS).

	 Note that workflow_sample_fragment0.xml embeds workflow_sample_fragment1.xml itself, 
	 using the "at-tls" symbol defined in the DTD, thus demonstrating that file inclusion can be nested.

			<br/><br/>You can use HTML tags in the description to format how this text is displayed	in the Workflows task. You might, for example, specify tags for:

        		<li>Lists, both ordered and unordered</li>
        		<li>Tables</li>
        		<li>Highlighting, such as <em>emphasis</em> and <strong>bold</strong>.</li>
        		<li><a href="http://www.ibm.com">Hyper-links</a>, which open in a separate tab or browser window.</li> 	
        	</ul> 
        	<br/><br/>Not all HTML tags are supported. 	For a list of supported HTML tags, see the z/OSMF Programming book.
