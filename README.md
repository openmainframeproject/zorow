# z/OS® Open Repository of Workflows (zorow)

## Description
This repository contains workflow definitions and other associated material that can be used with the z/OS® Management Facility (z/OSMF).

A z/OSMF workflow is a guided set of steps that help you perform an activity on z/OS®, such as configuring a software product, managing a z/OS® resource, or simplifying some relatively complex operation. To support these activities, a workflow can be designed to perform a wide variety of operations, such as configuring and starting z/OS® subsystems using the Cloud Provisioning and Management plug-in, submitting jobs and scripts, issuing REST APIs and invoking TSO/E functions.

Learn more about z/OSMF at https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.izu/izu.htm

If you are just getting started with z/OSMF workflows, it's recommended to review the [sample workflows](zOSMF-Samples/README.md) to better understand the capabilities.

## Installation
You can install any of these workflows into z/OSMF following the instructions on [creating workflow definitions for z/OS](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.izua700/izuprog_WorkflowsXML_Intro.htm).
